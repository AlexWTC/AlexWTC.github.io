This is my **school** GitHub account.  
This is a repository to hold *future* class assignments.

# **About Me**  
## My Hobbies & Interests:
### Hobbies
 * Ice Hockey  
   I play locally in the Triangle area in a "*Beer League*."
 * Video Games  
   Playing games goes hand in hand with *loving* computers <3. I need to see that frame rate ***soar***.
 * Messing with Computers  
   I love researching upcoming hardware and building computers. Is a **5090** *too* much to want? As I write this, I plan on helping a friend upgrade their PC.
 * Reading/Audio Books  
   There are many fascinating worlds in our minds, and books are the best way to find them. Sci-fi is one of my favorite genres!

### Other Interests
 * Cybersecurity and Privacy  
  I may be a little *paranoid*, but it's fascinating how people can "hack" devices. One day, I would like to do something about the privacy of our online information. Online information is too open for my liking right now.
 * Compliance & Models  
  What better way to stay safe than a trusted compliance model telling you precisely what you need to be secure. These are **imperative** if you strive to be safe in today's online world.

## My All-time Websites:
* [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/)
  * You can't go wrong with good music. I don't necessarily have anything against Spotify; I prefer YouTube's GUI. *Well... there is one thing...* the shuffle works wonders on YouTube Music!
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)
  * Do you need to know how something works, or are you just curious about how it does? Well, look no further than YouTube! Although the platform is seen as more of an *entertainment platform* these days, it can be a **great** resource for learning almost anything you want!
