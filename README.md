# **About Me**  
## My Hobbies & Interests:
### Hobbies
 * Ice Hockey  
   I play locally in the Triangle area in a "*Beer League*".
 * Video Games  
   Goes hand and hand with *loving* computers <3. I need to see that frame rate ***soar***.
 * Messing with Computers  
   I love researching upcoming hardware and building computers. Is a **5090** *too* much to want? As I'm writing this I'm planning on helping a friend out with upgrading their PC.
 * Reading/Audio Books  
  There are a lot of interesting worlds out their in our minds and books are the best way to find those. Sci-Fi is one of my faviorite genres!

### Other Interests
 * Cybersecurity and Privacy  
  I may be a little *paranoid* but it's facisnating the many ways people can "hack" devices. One day, I would like to do something about the privacy of our online informaiton. Online informaiton a little too *open* for my likings right now.
 * Compliance  
  What's a better way to stay safe then a trusted compliance model telling you exactly what you need to be secure. These are **imperative** if you strive to be safe in today's online world.

## My All-time Websites:
* [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/)
  * You can't go wrong with good music. I don't necessarily have anything against Spotify, I just prefer YouTube's GUI. *Well... there is one thing...* the shuffle works wonders on YouTube Music!
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)
  * Do you need to know how something works, or maybe you are just curious about how it does? Well look no further than YouTube! Although the platform is seen more of an *entertainment platform* these days, it can be a **great** resource to learning almost anything you want!
